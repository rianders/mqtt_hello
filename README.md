We're working on communication with python using mqtt. I need to create one piece of code to send a message to a broker, then I need to have a broker, also, I need to wrote another piece code subscribe to the message. How should I organize this and what might the code to look.

To organize your communication with Python using MQTT, you can use the Paho MQTT Python client library, which provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for sending and receiving messages over MQTT.

Here's an example of how you can create code to send a message to a broker using Paho MQTT:

pythonCopy code

`import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  # create a client instance client = mqtt.Client()  # connect to the broker client.connect("broker.example.com")  # publish a message to a topic client.publish("my/topic", "Hello, MQTT!")  # disconnect from the broker client.disconnect()`

In this example, we first create a client instance and connect it to the broker using the `connect()` method. Then we publish a message to the topic "my/topic" using the `publish()` method. Finally, we disconnect from the broker using the `disconnect()` method.

Next, you can create a broker instance using an MQTT broker like Mosquitto. You can install Mosquitto using the following command:

csharpCopy code

`sudo apt-get install mosquitto`

After installing Mosquitto, you can start the broker using the following command:

Copy code

`mosquitto`

This will start the Mosquitto broker on the default port (1883) and you can start using it to receive messages.

Finally, here's an example of how you can create code to subscribe to the message you sent earlier:

pythonCopy code

`import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  # define a callback function to handle incoming messages def on_message(client, userdata, message):     print("Received message:", message.payload.decode())  # create a client instance client = mqtt.Client()  # set the callback function for incoming messages client.on_message = on_message  # connect to the broker and subscribe to a topic client.connect("broker.example.com") client.subscribe("my/topic")  # start the MQTT client loop to receive incoming messages client.loop_forever()`

In this example, we first define a callback function `on_message` to handle incoming messages. Then we create a client instance and set the callback function using the `on_message` attribute. We connect to the broker and subscribe to the "my/topic" topic using the `connect()` and `subscribe()` methods. Finally, we start the MQTT client loop using the `loop_forever()` method to receive incoming messages.

With these pieces of code, you should be able to send and receive messages using MQTT in Python.

What might these files be called?

For the code that sends a message to a broker, you might name the file something like `mqtt_publisher.py` or `send_mqtt_message.py`.

For the code that subscribes to messages, you might name the file something like `mqtt_subscriber.py` or `receive_mqtt_message.py`.

Of course, you can choose whatever naming convention makes the most sense for your project and team. The important thing is to choose names that are clear and descriptive so that it's easy to understand what each file does.

I'm on a mac what of broker should I use?

If you're on a Mac, you can install Mosquitto (which is a popular open-source MQTT broker) using Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS.

Here are the steps to install Mosquitto using Homebrew:

1.  Install Homebrew, if you don't already have it, by running the following command in your Terminal:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
    
2.  Install Mosquitto by running the following command in your Terminal:
    
    Copy code
    
    `brew install mosquitto`
    

This will install Mosquitto on your Mac.

To start the Mosquitto broker, you can run the following command in your Terminal:

Copy code

`mosquitto`

This will start the Mosquitto broker on the default port (1883) and you can start using it to send and receive messages using MQTT.

Note that if you want Mosquitto to automatically start when you boot up your Mac, you can install it as a launchd service by running the following command:

sqlCopy code

`brew services start mosquitto`

This will start Mosquitto as a background service and ensure that it starts automatically on boot.

I'm running mosquitto locally, what's the connection string?

If you're running the Mosquitto broker locally on your Mac, the connection string you should use in your Python code to connect to the broker would be `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, which both refer to the IP address of your local machine.

Here's an example of how you can connect to the Mosquitto broker running locally on port 1883 using the Paho MQTT Python client library:

pythonCopy code

`import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  # create a client instance client = mqtt.Client()  # connect to the broker client.connect("localhost")  # ... do something with the MQTT client ...  # disconnect from the broker client.disconnect()`

In this example, we create a client instance and connect it to the Mosquitto broker running on the local machine using the `connect()` method and passing `localhost` as the argument.

Note that if you have changed the default port for Mosquitto in your configuration file, you will need to specify the port number explicitly in the connection string, like this:

pythonCopy code

`client.connect("localhost", port=1884)  # replace 1884 with your Mosquitto port number`

Replace `1884` with the actual port number you have configured for Mosquitto.

What python package needs to be installed

To use MQTT with Python, you need to install the Paho MQTT Python client library, which provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for sending and receiving messages over MQTT.

You can install the Paho MQTT Python client library using pip, which is the package installer for Python. To install it, run the following command in your Terminal:

Copy code

`pip install paho-mqtt`

This will download and install the latest version of the Paho MQTT Python client library and all its dependencies.

Once you have installed the `paho-mqtt` package, you can import the `paho.mqtt.client` module in your Python code to use the Paho MQTT client library.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![ricklon@fubarlabs.org](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F68374cb08ea38647b6bf7a0dedea82aa%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fri.png&w=64&q=75)

What kind of data can I pass?

MQTT is a protocol for sending and receiving messages between devices, and it is designed to be agnostic to the type of data being sent. This means that you can send any kind of data that can be represented as a sequence of bytes over MQTT.

In practice, the data you send over MQTT can be anything that can be serialized to bytes, including strings, integers, floating-point numbers, binary data, JSON data, XML data, and more.

When you send data over MQTT, you typically send it as a message payload, which is a sequence of bytes representing the data you want to send. The payload can be any length, as long as it does not exceed the maximum message size allowed by the MQTT broker or the network.

For example, if you want to send a string "Hello, MQTT!" over MQTT using Python, you can do it like this:

pythonCopy code

`import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  # create a client instance client = mqtt.Client()  # connect to the broker client.connect("broker.example.com")  # publish a message to a topic client.publish("my/topic", "Hello, MQTT!")  # disconnect from the broker client.disconnect()`

In this example, we publish the string "Hello, MQTT!" as the message payload to the topic "my/topic" using the `publish()` method of the Paho MQTT client library.

Note that the data you send over MQTT is not typed, so the receiver of the message will need to know how to interpret the data based on its own knowledge of the message format and the context in which it is being used.

Here's my topic: "homeassistant/plants/avocado" How can I subscribe to everything under homeassistant

To subscribe to all topics that start with a particular prefix, you can use the special MQTT wildcard character `#` (called a "hash" or "pound" symbol), which matches all remaining characters in a topic string.

In your case, if you want to subscribe to all topics that start with the prefix "homeassistant", you can use the topic filter `homeassistant/#`. This will match all topics that start with "homeassistant", including "homeassistant/plants/avocado", "homeassistant/lights/living-room", "homeassistant/sensors/temperature", and so on.

Here's an example of how you can subscribe to all topics that start with "homeassistant" using the Paho MQTT Python client library:

pythonCopy code

`import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  # define a callback function to handle incoming messages def on_message(client, userdata, message):     print("Received message:", message.payload.decode())  # create a client instance client = mqtt.Client()  # set the callback function for incoming messages client.on_message = on_message  # connect to the broker and subscribe to a topic client.connect("broker.example.com") client.subscribe("homeassistant/#")  # start the MQTT client loop to receive incoming messages client.loop_forever()`

In this example, we define a callback function `on_message` to handle incoming messages, which will be called whenever a message is received on any topic that matches the topic filter `homeassistant/#`. We create a client instance and set the callback function using the `on_message` attribute. We connect to the broker and subscribe to the "homeassistant/#" topic using the `connect()` and `subscribe()` methods. Finally, we start the MQTT client loop using the `loop_forever()` method to receive incoming messages.

Note that when you subscribe to a topic filter that includes the `#` wildcard character, you will receive messages on all topics that match the filter, including topics you did not explicitly subscribe to. Therefore, you should be careful when using the `#` wildcard and make sure that you only subscribe to the topics you actually want to receive messages on.

HOw can I use Homeassistant with this example of mqtt

To use Home Assistant with the example of MQTT that we have been discussing, you can configure Home Assistant to connect to the same MQTT broker and use the same MQTT topics that you are using in your Python code.

Here's an example of how you can configure Home Assistant to connect to the Mosquitto broker running on your Mac and subscribe to the "homeassistant/plants/avocado" topic:

yamlCopy code

`# configuration.yaml  mqtt:   broker: localhost   port: 1883  sensor:   - platform: mqtt     name: "Avocado Moisture"     state_topic: "homeassistant/plants/avocado"     unit_of_measurement: "%"`

In this example, we first configure the `mqtt` component in Home Assistant to connect to the Mosquitto broker running on `localhost` (which is your Mac). We also specify the port number to be 1883, which is the default port for Mosquitto.

Then, we configure a `sensor` component in Home Assistant to receive data from the "homeassistant/plants/avocado" topic using the MQTT protocol. We specify the `state_topic` as "homeassistant/plants/avocado", which matches the topic that we are publishing to in our Python code. We also give the sensor a name and a unit of measurement.

With this configuration, Home Assistant will listen for messages on the "homeassistant/plants/avocado" topic, and whenever it receives a message, it will update the "Avocado Moisture" sensor with the new value.

Note that this is just a simple example, and you can use MQTT with Home Assistant in many different ways, depending on your specific needs and use case. Home Assistant has built-in support for MQTT and provides many different MQTT components and platforms that you can use to integrate with other devices and services.

How can I make the broker public on my mac?

If you want to make your Mosquitto broker public on your Mac, you will need to configure your router to allow incoming connections on the Mosquitto port (default is 1883). This will allow devices outside of your local network to connect to your Mosquitto broker and send/receive MQTT messages.

Here are the steps to make your Mosquitto broker public on your Mac:

1.  Find your public IP address by searching "what's my IP address" in Google or any search engine. This will show you your public IP address, which is the IP address that devices outside of your local network use to connect to your router.
    
2.  Configure your router to forward incoming connections on the Mosquitto port to your Mac. The exact steps to do this depend on your router model and firmware, but you can usually find instructions by searching for your router model online. You will need to set up a port forwarding rule that forwards incoming connections on port 1883 to the local IP address of your Mac.
    
3.  Test the connection by connecting to your Mosquitto broker from a device outside of your local network. You can use any MQTT client to do this, such as MQTT.fx, and connect to your public IP address and the Mosquitto port (1883). If the connection is successful, you should be able to send and receive MQTT messages to/from your Mosquitto broker.
    

Note that making your Mosquitto broker public can be a security risk, as it exposes your local network to the internet. You should make sure to secure your Mosquitto broker with a strong password and enable TLS encryption to protect your MQTT messages from eavesdropping and tampering. You should also monitor your Mosquitto logs for any suspicious activity and update your Mosquitto and router firmware regularly to patch any security vulnerabilities.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![ricklon@fubarlabs.org](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F68374cb08ea38647b6bf7a0dedea82aa%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fri.png&w=64&q=75)

When I run mosquitto what command do I need to give to bind it to 0.0.0.0?

To bind the Mosquitto broker to all available network interfaces (including 0.0.0.0), you can use the `-p` option to specify the port number and the `-v` option to enable verbose logging.

Here's the command you can use to start Mosquitto and bind it to all network interfaces:

cssCopy code

`mosquitto -p 1883 -v`

In this command, we use the `-p` option to specify the port number (1883, which is the default MQTT port) and the `-v` option to enable verbose logging. The `-v` option is optional, but it can be useful for debugging connection issues and seeing what messages are being sent/received.

With this command, Mosquitto will start and bind to all available network interfaces, allowing devices on your local network to connect to it using the IP address of your Mac. Note that if you want to make your Mosquitto broker accessible from outside your local network, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router as described in my previous answer.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![ricklon@fubarlabs.org](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F68374cb08ea38647b6bf7a0dedea82aa%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fri.png&w=64&q=75)

My broker is now on this ip: 192.168.1.176

If your Mosquitto broker is running on the IP address `192.168.1.176`, you can use this IP address to connect to the broker from other devices on your local network.

In your Python code, you can connect to the Mosquitto broker on this IP address like this:

pythonCopy code

`import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  # create a client instance client = mqtt.Client()  # connect to the broker client.connect("192.168.1.176")  # ... do something with the MQTT client ...  # disconnect from the broker client.disconnect()`

In this example, we create a client instance and connect it to the Mosquitto broker running on the IP address `192.168.1.176` using the `connect()` method.

Similarly, if you are using Home Assistant, you can configure it to connect to the Mosquitto broker on this IP address like this:

yamlCopy code

`# configuration.yaml  mqtt:   broker: 192.168.1.176   port: 1883  sensor:   - platform: mqtt     name: "Avocado Moisture"     state_topic: "homeassistant/plants/avocado"     unit_of_measurement: "%"`

In this example, we configure the `mqtt` component in Home Assistant to connect to the Mosquitto broker running on the IP address `192.168.1.176`. We also specify the port number to be 1883, which is the default port for Mosquitto.

I just got a messager sayin connection regused

If you received a message saying "connection refused" when trying to connect to your Mosquitto broker, there could be several possible reasons for this:

1.  Mosquitto is not running: Make sure that the Mosquitto broker is running and listening for incoming connections. You can check if Mosquitto is running by using the `ps` command in your Terminal:
    
    perlCopy code
    
    `ps -ef | grep mosquitto`
    
    This should show you a list of processes running on your Mac, including the Mosquitto broker if it is running. If you don't see any Mosquitto processes, it means that Mosquitto is not running and you need to start it using the `mosquitto` command.
    
2.  Incorrect IP address or port number: Make sure that you are using the correct IP address and port number to connect to the Mosquitto broker. If the Mosquitto broker is running on a different machine or on a different port number, you need to use the correct IP address and port number in your Python code.
    
3.  Firewall or network issues: Make sure that there are no firewalls or network issues that are blocking incoming connections to the Mosquitto broker. If you are trying to connect from a different machine or network, you may need to configure your firewall or network settings to allow incoming connections on the Mosquitto port (1883 by default).
    
4.  Authentication or security issues: Make sure that you are using the correct username and password (if required) to connect to the Mosquitto broker. If you have enabled TLS encryption or other security measures, make sure that your Python code is configured to use the correct security settings.
    

If you have checked all of these possible causes and are still unable to connect to the Mosquitto broker, you may need to check the Mosquitto logs (`/var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log` by default) for more information on why the connection is being refused.

4.  Authentication or security issues: Make sure that you are using the correct username and password (if required) to connect to the Mosquitto broker. If you have enabled TLS encryption or other security measures, make sure that your Python code is configured to use the correct security settings.
    

If you have checked all of these possible causes and are still unable to connect to the Mosquitto broker, you may need to check the Mosquitto logs (`/var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log` by default) for more information on why the connection is being refused.

I found that I get this message so the command didn't make it public: 1678656098: Starting in local only mode. Connections will only be possible from clients running on this machine.

The message you received indicates that the Mosquitto broker is running in local only mode, which means that it is only accepting connections from clients running on the same machine. This is why you are not able to connect to the Mosquitto broker from other devices on your local network.

To make your Mosquitto broker accessible from other devices on your local network, you need to modify the Mosquitto configuration file (`mosquitto.conf`) to allow incoming connections from remote clients.

Here are the steps to modify the Mosquitto configuration file:

1.  Open the Mosquitto configuration file (`mosquitto.conf`) in a text editor. The configuration file is usually located in `/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/` on Mac.
    
2.  Find the line that starts with `bind_address` or `bind_interface`. This line specifies the network interface or IP address that the Mosquitto broker is bound to. If this line is commented out (starts with `#`), remove the comment symbol to enable it.
    
3.  Replace the value of `bind_address` or `bind_interface` with `0.0.0.0`. This will tell Mosquitto to bind to all available network interfaces, allowing remote clients to connect to it.
    
4.  Save the configuration file and restart the Mosquitto broker using the `mosquitto` command.
    

After modifying the configuration file and restarting the Mosquitto broker, you should be able to connect to it from other devices on your local network using the IP address of your Mac.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![ricklon@fubarlabs.org](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F68374cb08ea38647b6bf7a0dedea82aa%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fri.png&w=64&q=75)

I added listener 1883 0.0.0.0 and I added -c to the mosquitto command line and it finds the configuration

Great, adding `listener 1883 0.0.0.0` to the Mosquitto configuration file and using the `-c` option to specify the configuration file in the `mosquitto` command should allow you to make the Mosquitto broker public on your Mac and accept connections from remote clients.

Here are the steps to make your Mosquitto broker public using the configuration file:

1.  Open the Mosquitto configuration file (`mosquitto.conf`) in a text editor. The configuration file is usually located in `/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/` on Mac.
    
2.  Add the following line to the configuration file to listen on all available network interfaces (including 0.0.0.0) on port 1883:
    
    yamlCopy code
    
    `listener 1883 0.0.0.0`
    
    This will allow devices outside of your local network to connect to your Mosquitto broker on port 1883.
    
3.  Save the configuration file and start the Mosquitto broker using the following command:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf -v`
    
    This will start the Mosquitto broker and use the configuration file at `/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`. The `-v` option is optional, but it can be useful for debugging connection issues and seeing what messages are being sent/received.
    

With these steps, your Mosquitto broker should be accessible from outside your local network, allowing you to connect to it from other devices using your public IP address and the Mosquitto port (1883 by default).

Now my message publisher is getting a message saying not authorized

If your MQTT message publisher is getting a "not authorized" error message when trying to connect to your Mosquitto broker, it means that the broker is configured to require authentication and the publisher is not providing valid authentication credentials.

Here are the steps to configure authentication for your Mosquitto broker:

1.  Create an MQTT username and password that will be used for authentication. You can use the `mosquitto_passwd` command to create a password file that contains the username and password:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `mosquitto_passwd -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/passwd mqtt_user`
    
    In this example, we create a password file at `/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/passwd` with the username `mqtt_user`. The `mosquitto_passwd` command will prompt you to enter a password for the user.
    
2.  Modify the Mosquitto configuration file (`mosquitto.conf`) to enable authentication and specify the location of the password file:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `# enable authentication allow_anonymous false password_file /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/passwd`
    
    In this example, we set `allow_anonymous` to `false` to require authentication for all clients, and specify the location of the password file that we created in the previous step.
    
3.  Save the configuration file and restart the Mosquitto broker using the `mosquitto` command.
    

After configuring authentication, your MQTT message publisher will need to provide valid authentication credentials (username and password) when connecting to the Mosquitto broker. In your Python code, you can provide the username and password like this:

pythonCopy code

`import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  # create a client instance client = mqtt.Client()  # set username and password client.username_pw_set("mqtt_user", "password")  # connect to the broker client.connect("192.168.1.176")  # ... do something with the MQTT client ...  # disconnect from the broker client.disconnect()`

In this example, we use the `username_pw_set()` method to set the username and password for the MQTT client, and then connect to the Mosquitto broker using the `connect()` method.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![ricklon@fubarlabs.org](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F68374cb08ea38647b6bf7a0dedea82aa%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fri.png&w=64&q=75)

Now that that's work can you summarize the steps for running the server?

Sure, here's a summary of the steps to run the Mosquitto broker with authentication enabled on a Mac:

1.  Install Mosquitto using Homebrew:
    
    Copy code
    
    `brew install mosquitto`
    
2.  Create an MQTT username and password for authentication using the `mosquitto_passwd` command:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `mosquitto_passwd -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/passwd mqtt_user`
    
    This creates a password file at `/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/passwd` with the username `mqtt_user`. You will be prompted to enter a password for the user.
    
3.  Edit the Mosquitto configuration file (`mosquitto.conf`) to enable authentication and specify the location of the password file:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `# enable authentication allow_anonymous false password_file /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/passwd`
    
    Save the configuration file.
    
4.  Start the Mosquitto broker with the following command:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf -v`
    
    This starts the Mosquitto broker with the configuration file at `/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` and verbose logging enabled (`-v` option).
    
5.  To connect to the Mosquitto broker from a Python script using the Paho MQTT client library, use the following code to set the username and password:
    
    pythonCopy code
    
    `import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  # create a client instance client = mqtt.Client()  # set username and password client.username_pw_set("mqtt_user", "password")  # connect to the broker client.connect("192.168.1.176")  # ... do something with the MQTT client ...  # disconnect from the broker client.disconnect()`
    
    Replace `mqtt_user` and `password` with the username and password that you created earlier. Replace `192.168.1.176` with the IP address of your Mac that is running the Mosquitto broker.
    

That's it! With these steps, you should have a Mosquitto broker running on your Mac with authentication enabled, and be able to connect to it from a Python script using the Paho MQTT client library.

How can I now connect to this using homeassistant

To connect Home Assistant to your Mosquitto broker, you need to add a MQTT broker configuration to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file.

Here are the steps to configure Home Assistant to use your Mosquitto broker:

1.  Open your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file in a text editor.
    
2.  Add the following lines to configure the MQTT broker:
    
    yamlCopy code
    
    `mqtt:   broker: 192.168.1.176   port: 1883   username: mqtt_user   password: password`
    
    Replace `192.168.1.176` with the IP address of your Mosquitto broker, `mqtt_user` with the username that you created earlier, and `password` with the password for the user.
    
    You can also specify additional options, such as `client_id` and `tls`, if needed. See the Home Assistant documentation for more details.
    
3.  Save the `configuration.yaml` file and restart Home Assistant.
    

After configuring the MQTT broker in Home Assistant, you can use the MQTT integration to publish and subscribe to MQTT messages.

For example, you can create a sensor to subscribe to the `homeassistant/plants/avocado` topic that you mentioned earlier by adding the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

yamlCopy code

`sensor:   - platform: mqtt     name: "Avocado Plant Moisture"     state_topic: "homeassistant/plants/avocado"     unit_of_measurement: "%"`

This creates a sensor named "Avocado Plant Moisture" that subscribes to the `homeassistant/plants/avocado` topic and displays the message payload as a percentage.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![ricklon@fubarlabs.org](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F68374cb08ea38647b6bf7a0dedea82aa%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fri.png&w=64&q=75)

Can you show this process in source code markdown?

Sure! Here's an example of how you can configure Home Assistant to use your Mosquitto broker in source code markdown:

yamlCopy code

`# configuration.yaml  mqtt:   broker: 192.168.1.176   port: 1883   username: mqtt_user   password: password  sensor:   - platform: mqtt     name: "Avocado Plant Moisture"     state_topic: "homeassistant/plants/avocado"     unit_of_measurement: "%"`

In this example, we first configure the MQTT broker by adding the `mqtt` section to the `configuration.yaml` file. We specify the IP address of the Mosquitto broker (`192.168.1.176`), the port number (`1883`), and the username and password that we created earlier.

We then create a sensor using the `mqtt` platform to subscribe to the `homeassistant/plants/avocado` topic and display the message payload as a percentage. The `name` option specifies the name of the sensor, and the `unit_of_measurement` option specifies the units of the sensor value.

Note that the code snippet above is just an example and you may need to adjust the configuration options to match your specific setup. You should consult the Home Assistant documentation for more information on configuring MQTT and creating sensors using the `mqtt` platform.

What's a good way to ask for something to be show in markdown as source code?

A good way to ask for something to be shown in markdown as source code is to use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to create a code block and specify the language (if applicable). For example:

markdownCopy code

`Here's an example of some code:  ```python print("Hello, world!")`

This will output `Hello, world!` to the console.

swiftCopy code

`This will produce the following output:  Here's an example of some code:  ```python print("Hello, world!")`

This will output `Hello, world!` to the console.

You can replace `python` with the appropriate language if you're using a different programming language.
